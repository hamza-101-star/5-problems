This program checks whether a number entered by the user is a prime number.

How it works:
The user is asked to input a number, which is stored as an integer.

The program first checks if the number is greater than 1, since prime numbers are defined as greater than 1.

It then uses a for loop to check if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and itself (exclusive):

If a divisor is found, it's not a prime number.

If no divisors are found, the number is prime.

The else attached to the for loop runs only if the loop completes without hitting break, meaning no divisors were found.
