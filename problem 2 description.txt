This program calculates the area of a rectangle based on user input.

How it works:
It prompts the user to enter the width and height of a rectangle using the input() function.

The input values are converted to floating-point numbers using float() to allow decimal values.

The area is calculated using the formula: Area = Width Ã— Height
