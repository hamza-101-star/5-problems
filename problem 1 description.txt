This is a basic Python program designed to interact with the user by asking for their name and then greeting them personally.

How it works:
The program uses the input() function to prompt the user to enter their name.

It stores the entered name in a variable called name.

Using an f-string, it prints a personalized greeting message that includes the user's name.
