How it works:
The user is prompted to input an integer. The input is converted from a string to an integer using int().

The program uses the modulo operator (%) to divide the number by 2 and check the remainder.

If the remainder is 0, the number is even.

If the remainder is not 0, the number is odd.

The result is displayed using print() with an f-string.
