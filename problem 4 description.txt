This Python program is a simple number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 10.

How it works:
The random module is imported to generate random numbers.

A random number between 1 and 10 is generated using random.randint(1, 10) and stored in the variable secret_number.

The user is asked to input a guess, which is converted from a string to an integer using int().

The program compares the user's guess with the secret number:

If the guess matches, the user is congratulated.

If not, the program reveals the correct number.
